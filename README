NOTE

The Ungoogled patches are modified to apply to a stock Debian Chromium tree,
without any other Ungoogled patches applied.  Typically, this means that the
following patches must be removed from the Debian patch series and reverted
from the source tree before this repository can be used:
 * ungoogled/disable-privacy-sandbox.patch

Be aware that since Debian already carries cookie deactivation patches the
associated patch in the Ungoogled tree has also been removed.  If you are
considering applying this Ungoogled patch series to a non-Debian Chromium tree,
it may be a good idea to use the upstream Ungoogled patch series as a starting
point instead of this patch series.

If building a Debian package, and the Ungoogled patches are applied, the
following build flags will need to be set in the debian/rules file:
 * safe_browsing_mode=0
 * build_with_tflite_lib=false

These flags are NOT required for the base ppc64el patchset alone.
