MINIMUM SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

**PATCHED** LLVM 17 or higher

**** PATCH REQUIREMENTS ****
LLVM 17 and up miscompile floating point libcalls with signed integer arguments
on all architectures.  Since LLVM 16 significantly miscompiles ppc64el code
(leading to Chromium segfaults), LLVM 17 or higher will need to have a patch
applied prior to building Chromium.  If this is not done, the browser will
consume massive system resources and randomly crash.

The patch currently resides in a pull request for LLVM on Github:
https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/pull/109134

This patch applies successfully to Clang 18, which SSC is currently using to
build its production Chromium on POWER packages.  Hopefully, it will be
merged shortly and backported to Clang 19 / Clang 18.

**** WARNING ****
LLVM 16 is known to miscompile part of v8!

At optimization levels higher than -O0, when using LTO, under specific
circumstances involving array access of floating point numbers, the following
(condensed) invalid instruction sequence is emitted:

li      r4,-15
rldic   r4,r4,3,29
lfdx    f1,r3,r4

Examples bytecode files that trigger the issue are located in
compiler_bugs/clang_16/strtod_o[0|1].bc for analysis.

To see the invalid assembler, compile to native object code via:
llc-16 strtod_o1.bc -filetype=obj -o strtod.o

and disassemble via:
objdump -S strtod.o

Note that llc-17 emits a completely different and more sensible instruction
sequence:

subfic  r6,r8,15
rldic   r4,r6,3,29
lfdx    f1,r5,r4

where r8 is loaded via other setup routines prior to entering the index
access segment of the code.  Likely, the optimizer in Clang 16 makes an
incorrect assumption about r8 (in this example) always equalling 0x0, when
in fact 0x0 would be an invalid value for r8.

NOTE

The Ungoogled patches are modified to apply to a stock Debian Chromium tree,
without any other Ungoogled patches applied.  Typically, this means that the
following patches must be removed from the Debian patch series and reverted
from the source tree before this repository can be used:
 * ungoogled/disable-privacy-sandbox.patch

Be aware that since Debian already carries cookie deactivation patches the
associated patch in the Ungoogled tree has also been removed.  If you are
considering applying this Ungoogled patch series to a non-Debian Chromium tree,
it may be a good idea to use the upstream Ungoogled patch series as a starting
point instead of this patch series.

If building a Debian package, and the Ungoogled patches are applied, the
following build flags will need to be set in the debian/rules file:
 * safe_browsing_mode=0
 * build_with_tflite_lib=false

These flags are NOT required for the base ppc64el patchset alone.
